### Project 1: Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. --- wiki

### Project 2: Logistic Regression
In statistics, logistic regression, or logit regression, or logit model[1] is a regression model where the dependent variable (DV) is categorical. This article covers the case of a binary dependent variable—that is, where the output can take only two values, "0" and "1", which represent outcomes such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. --- wiki

### Project 3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
In machine learning, multiclass or multinomial classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes.  --- wiki
Neural network, or artificial neural network, is a computing system inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. --- wiki
